=================

The PyMongo distribution contains four top-level packages for
interacting with MongoDB. :mod:`bson` is an implementation of the
`BSON format <http://bsonspec.org>`_, :mod:`pymongo` is a
full-featured driver for MongoDB, and :mod:`gridfs` is a set of tools
for working with the `GridFS
<http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/GridFS+Specification>`_ storage
specification. :mod:`motor` is an asynchronous wrapper for using MongoDB with
`Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_.
