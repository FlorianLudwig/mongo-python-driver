Limitations
===========

* Multithreading and forking are not supported; Motor is intended to be part of
  a single-threaded Tornado application.
* GridFS is not yet supported.
* Support is planned soon for all the Python versions supported by Tornado,
  but for now only Python 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 work. Compatibility with Python 3.2
  and 3.3 will come soon.
